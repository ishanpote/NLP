LIST OF EXPERIMENTS (As per GROUP’s)
(Based on the topics you provided)

1. 	Demonstrate the Basics of Text Processing
GROUP 3 - Convert a given text to lowercase and remove punctuation.
GROUP 2 - Perform basic preprocessing: lowercase, punctuation removal, and word tokenization.
GROUP 1 - Design a complete text preprocessing pipeline including whitespace normalization and tokenization.

2. 	Implement the Meaning of Words Using Stemming
GROUP 3 - Apply stemming to simple words to obtain their root form.
GROUP 2 - Perform stemming on every word in a given sentence.
GROUP 1 - Compare the results of two different stemming algorithms.

3. 	Demonstrate Sentence Tokenization
GROUP 3 - Split a paragraph into sentences using simple sentence boundary rules.
GROUP 2 - Tokenize sentences from a paragraph using an NLP library.
GROUP 1 - Tokenize sentences and correctly handle special cases (e.g., abbreviations).

4. 	Remove Stop Words
GROUP 3 - Identify and remove stop words from a given sentence.
GROUP 2 - Remove stop words and produce both the original and filtered versions of text.
GROUP 1 - Remove stop words using a custom stop-word list created by the student.

5. 	Apply the Porter Stemming Algorithm
GROUP 3 - Apply the Porter Stemmer to a list of basic words.
GROUP 2 - Apply Porter Stemming to all words in a paragraph.
GROUP 1 - Implement a simplified stemming mechanism without using libraries.

6. 	Parsing and Semantic Detection of Similar Sentences
GROUP 3 - Compare two sentences to identify whether their meanings are similar.
GROUP 2 - Extract nouns and verbs using POS tagging to compare sentence similarity.
GROUP 1 - Compute semantic similarity between two sentences using embeddings or vector-based representations.

7. 	Demonstrate Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
GROUP 3 - Assign POS tags to words in a simple sentence.
GROUP 2 - Perform POS tagging on a full paragraph using an NLP toolkit.
GROUP 1 - Compare POS tagging results between two different NLP systems.

8. 	Demonstrate Semantic Analysis
GROUP 3 - Identify whether a sentence expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
GROUP 2 - Perform sentiment analysis on multiple sentences to classify their sentiment polarity.
GROUP 1 - Analyze semantic similarity between sentences using a semantic model or embeddings.
